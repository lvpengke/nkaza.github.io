      <description>I work at the intersection of urbanization patterns, local energy policy, and equity. In my research, I seek to understand the motivations, intentions and plans of multiple actors endowed with limited capabilities, imperfect foresight and distributed authority, in urban settings. Lately, I have been studying these issues in the context of local energy planning. I routinely use high cadence, large geospatial and temporal datasets and novel quantitative methods in my research.</description>
