      <description>There was a recent email on PLANET Google Groups asking about what the &amp;lsquo;top journals&amp;rsquo; were in the field. I wrote a response, while not directly answering the question. This post is an elaboration/edit of that post.
Do we need journal any more? I say this as/has been an associate editor for journals and appreciating the full scope of publication infrastructure that publishers provide. I also appreciate the need for cognitive shortcuts to quickly evaluate the value of research by looking to the reputation of the journal.</description>
