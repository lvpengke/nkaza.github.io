<div id="introduction" class="section level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Networks are ubiqutous in a urban systems. The more obvious ones are street, rail and utility networks that undergird the city. However, as planners we also focus on less obvious networks; e.g. social networks of people that allow for community formation, the transactional activity of firms that allow us to identify clusters of firms or industries, the mismatch between job seekers and job locations to better plan for social and physical infrastructure and information flow through organisational linkages during a disaster management process. These are but a few examples of network analysis in the urban domain. The problem definition frames the analytical tools used in the process.</p>
</div>
<div id="acquire-data" class="section level1">
<h1>Acquire Data</h1>
<p>In this post, I am going to explore multiple datasets in different problem domains to demonstrate the importance and applicability of network analysis in cities. Therefore, we will use different datasets and are linked in different sections, if they are not automatically downloadable.</p>
</div>
<div id="key-nodes-in-a-network" class="section level1">
<h1>Key nodes in a network</h1>
<p>Let’s begin by using the bike share data from New York, we are familiar with. We <a href="https://sia.planning.unc.edu/post/geospatial-data-in-r/">already did some network analysis</a> with it (inadvertently). Let’s formalise it.</p>
<p>Networks are representation of connections between two nodes. As such bike stations, could be treated a vertex/node and each trip between any two stations could be treated as a link. In another representation, you can treat all stations connected with one another, if they belong to the same company that you can check out and return these bikes and treat the number of trips as weights on that edge; so some edges will have zero weights. In other instances, you may disallow edges that have zero weights, i.e. remove the connection between two stations if there are no trips between them (or number of trips below a threshold).</p>
<p>Much of the following is <a href="./datasets/201806-citibike-tripdata.csv">data</a> cleaning that you should be familiar with now.</p>

<h2>Degrees &amp; their distribution.</h2>
<p>Degree of a vertex, in graph theory, refers to the number of edges that has the vertex as one of its ends. An in-degree and out-degree qualifies it, by counting only edges that start and end at the vertex. Degree distributions are important for graphs as they tell us about how connected the graph is and which if any of the vertices are more important than others.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>degree(trips_graph, mode = &#39;out&#39;) %&gt;%
  as.tibble %&gt;%

<pre class="r"><code>

<p>In particular, you want to look for the outliers in the distribution. For example to find the stations with only end trips but no start trips, i.e stations that are solely destinations</p>
<pre class="r"><code>V(trips_graph)$name[degree(trips_graph, mode=&quot;out&quot;) == 0 &amp; degree(trips_graph, mode=&quot;in&quot;) &gt; 0]
#  [1] &quot;3245&quot; &quot;3267&quot; &quot;3275&quot; &quot;3192&quot; &quot;3276&quot; &quot;3184&quot; &quot;3214&quot; &quot;3651&quot; &quot;3198&quot; &quot;3199&quot;
# [11] &quot;3203&quot;</code></pre>
<p>We can also visualise these stations that are popular origins on the map. However, we need to attach the values to the station locations tibble.</p>

The eigenvector centrality <span class="math inline">\(x_{i}\)</span> of node <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is given by: <span class="math display">\[x_i = \frac{1}{\lambda} \sum_{k} a_{ki} \, x_k\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\lambda \neq 0\)</span> is a constant.</p>
<p>Intutively, a node is considered more central/important, if it is connected to large number of highly central/important nodes. So, a node may have a high degree score (i.e. many connections) but a relatively low eigen centrality score if many of those connections are with similarly low-scored nodes.</p>

<h3>Closeness centrality</h3>
<p>While the above measures of centrality depend on local neighborhood, we can also take into account the whole graph. For example, if a station can every station within a few hops, then it is considered more central than ones that may have more localised trips within the neighborhood.</p>

<p>These seems like unsual stations to be outliers in a centrality index (bike mechanics??) and unlike the page rank index. A closer look at the centrality using box plot reveals that these are outliers at the left end of the centrality distribution.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of centrality measures out there. Be careful to pick and choose the right ones for your proiblem. To assist with this, you can use <code>CINNA</code> (Central Informative Nodes in Network Analysis) package for computing, analyzing and comparing centrality measures submitted to CRAN repository.</p>

<h2>Community Detection</h2>
<p>Finding a community structure in a network is to identify clusters of nodes that are more strongly connected within the cluster than to nodes outside the cluster. There are many algorithms that identify community structures. Some work on weigthed networks and some work on digraphs. In any case it is better to convert multigraph (graph with two nodes having multiple edges) into a simple graph with edge weights, representing the number of trips.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>E(trips_graph)$weight &lt;- 1
station_graph  &lt;- simplify(trips_graph, edge.attr.comb=&quot;sum&quot;)

ecount(station_graph) == ecount(trips_graph)
# [1] FALSE
sum(E(station_graph)$weight) == ecount(trips_graph)
# [1] TRUE
all.equal(vcount(station_graph), vcount(trips_graph))
# [1] TRUE

is.directed(station_graph)
# [1] TRUE</code></pre>
<p>Walktrap algorithm finds the communities by random walks in the graph. The intuition is that random walks are more likely to be within a community that across communities.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>wlktrp_mmbr &lt;- data.frame (clstrmm  = cluster_walktrap(station_graph)$membership %&gt;% as.factor, 
                          stid = V(station_graph)$name %&gt;% as.numeric()
                          ) %&gt;% as.tibble()

<h1>Conclusions</h1>
<p>Network analysis techniques provide a very useful set of tools that we can apply in many contexts in urban analytics. Networks are ubiquitous and the above two are but few of the situations where network tools can be readily applied. They need to be used more, and used judiciously.</p>
